    ### About This Application
    This code is designed for Magic The Gathering players, but it actually applies to any Trading Card Game.  
    The app computes the probability of drawing a certain number of cards (`k`) out of a certain number of draws (`n`), 
    considering that the deck has `N` total cards and `K` cards of the interested type.

    The algorithm is based on the hypergeometric distribution. Please refer to the Wikipedia page for more details on the math: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution

    In the following you can find some examples.

    **Example 1**: You want to know what is the probability to draw 3 lands (`k=3`) in an opening hand (`n=7`) 
    knowing that your deck has `N=60` cards and a total of `K=24` lands. 

    **Example 2**: You are playing a MTG modern game i.e., the deck has 60 cards. You are at turn 5, and you already drew your opening hand plus 5 other cards because you were on the draw.
    The total number of cards left in your deck are, then, 60-7-5=48. You are running dry on lands since you played only 3 of the 21 lands you have in your deck. This means that in your deck you are left with 18 lands.
    To corerctly decide how to play your next turn, you want to know what is the probability to find one, two or three lands in the next 3 turns i.e., the next 3 draws. In this case you just have to set `N=48`, `K=18`, `k=1,2,3`, `n=3`.
